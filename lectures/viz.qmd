# Grammar of Graphics

  - visualization in general 
  - why not just a single command to plot? - Why we want layers
  - build a graph from layer to layer using ggplot2 
    - blank
    - add geometry (point, line, histogram, density,text/ label)
    - add aesthetic mappings (x, y, group, color, fill)
    - add facet
    - theme, 
    - scale
      - color, fill: 
        - base R color `RColorBrewer`, `colorspace`: qualitative, sequential, diverging
        - how to pick a good color palette?
        - legend text edit
        - legend position
      - datetime: date break
    - coordinate system 
    - can you figure it out how to do this?
    - missing value: msg 
    - `patchwork`
  - some judgement: Is this a good plot? 
  - How about let's be evil `emo::ji("devil")`
  - a sea of possibility: ggplot2 extensions
