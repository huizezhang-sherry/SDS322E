## [SDS 322E: Elements of Data Science]{.r-fit-text} 

* Lecture: Monday / Wednesday / Friday 9-10am
* Lab: Monday 3-4pm/ 4-5pm
* Instructor: Sherry Zhang
* Grad TA: Arka Sinha
* UGCAs: Daniel, Luke, Vibhav

## Learning objectives 

**End goal**: Become comfortable coding in R for both exploratory (week 1-8) and confirmatory analysis (week 9-14), and develop enough breadth of knowledge to know where to find the tools and information you need. 

. . .

Specifically, you will learn:

  * Program for data analysis in R using RStudio
  * Wrangle and visualize data with the tidyverse
  * Apply prediction and classification techniques



## Weekly schedule

# Questions?

## Hello, I'm Sherry 

::::{.columms}

:::{.column width="60%"}

 - I'm a Postdoc Fellow in SDS. I did my PhD in Monash University in Australia. 
 
 - I work on visualization, statistical computing, and thinking about "what's the best way to do data analysis".
 
 - I climb `r set.seed(123); emo::ji("climber")`, and occasionally run.

# Trick 101 to make you slightly more comfortable in R and RStudio

## Install R and RStudio

* R is available for free: <https://cloud.r-project.org/>
* RStudio can be downloaded for free from the Posit website: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

Even if you installed R/RStudio previously, it's important to have the latest version

* R version 4.5.1 
  * Check your current version with `R.version`
* RStudio version 2025.05.1-513

## RStudio IDE

<center>![](figures/rstudio.png){width="90%"}</center>

## Your time {.smaller}

Change the appearance of your RStudio IDE: 

  * Press `Command + ,` to pull out the options panel
  * Select the Appearance tab and find your favorite Editor font and theme

<center>![](figures/rstudio-appearance.png){width="80%"}</center>

## Git and GitHub 

General speaking, you can navigate the course without knowing anything about Git and GitHub, but you will be able to see and know many things you would otherwise won't if you do know a little bit. 

  - If you know how to browse GitHub, you can see the source code of the packages we use in the course, and you can also see the source code of the lecture slides.

  - Happy Git with R: <https://happygitwithr.com/>
  
## Find the `pkgdown` site of a package {.smaller background-image="figures/dplyr-pkgdown-1.png" background-size="65%" background-position="50% 70%"}

Go to <https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr> and click the package link:

## {.smaller}

The `pkgdown` site contains the exact same information as `?PKG::FUN()` but the HTML version is much better formatted.

:::{.column}

From the pkgdown site:

:::{.column}

From `?dplyr::summarise`:

The `pkgdown` sites also have more detailed vignettes (aka articles) about the package:

## Coding is never memorization!

Ask anyone you know working with data or software to write down what they just code on a piece of paper: fail...

<br> <br>

<center>What I mean by this `r set.seed(1234); emo::ji("arrow")`</center>

## [Example: search and install from GitHub]{.r-fit-text} {.smaller}

I want to add emoji in the lecture slides and I know there is the `emo` package. The syntax is `emo::ji("emoji_name")`. Type in the console:

```{r eval = FALSE}
emo::ji("evil")
```

> Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘emo’

Okay... I don't have the package in my lastest R installation, let's install it...

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("emo")
```

> Warning in install.packages : package ‘emo’ is not available for this version of R A version of this package for your version of R might be available elsewhere, see the ideas at https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Installing-packages

## [Example: search and install from GitHub]{.r-fit-text} {.smaller}

Aha - it's GitHub package (I know it is written by Hadley Wickham), let me find it:

```         
Google: emo ji Hadley github
```

and find this:

<center>![](figures/emoji-github.png)</center>

## [Example: search and install from GitHub]{.r-fit-text}

Scroll down to find this line, and run it in your console:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")
```

Now I can use the package:

```{r}
emo::ji("devil")
```

Lesson learnt:

-   No one can write the code in one go, we use a lot of helps ... and Google!
-   btw you just learned how to install a package both from CRAN (`install.packages()`) and from GitHub (`remotes::install_github()`).

## Your time {.smaller}

- Install and load the `tidyverse` package from CRAN
  * Install: `install.packages("tidyverse")` 
  * Load: `library(tidyverse)`

- (advance) Install and load the `emo` package from GitHub

  * Install the CRAN package `devtools` first: `install.packages("devtools")`
  * Install the `emo` package from GitHub: `devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")`
  * Load the library: `library(emo)`
  * Print your favorite emoji, e.g. `emo::ji("heart")`
