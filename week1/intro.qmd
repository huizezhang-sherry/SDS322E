## SDS 322E: Elements of Data Science

lecture, lab, instructor, Grad TA: UGCAs:

## Course schedule

## Weekly schedule

## Assessement

## Learning objectives

end goal: be comfortable to code in R to do some analysis and have enough breadth of knowledge to know where to look for things you need

## Resources {.smaller background-image="figures/books.png" background-size="30%" background-position="50% 80%"}

-   **R for Data Science**: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/
-   **ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (3e)** https://ggplot2-book.org/
-   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2?sort=frequent&pageSize=50) is a great source of answers to common ggplot2 questions. It is also a great place to get help, once you have created a reproducible example that illustrates your problem.

## What you not learn 

-   calculus, linear algebra, probability
-   latex

## Why data science

## About me

Postdoc, research on visualization, data analysis

# Use of LLMs

-   make up functions, old functions...

## Install R and RStudio

* R is available for free: <https://cloud.r-project.org/>
* RStudio can be downloaded for free from the Posit website: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

Even if you installed R/RStudio previously, it's important to have the latest version

* R version 4.5.1 
  * Check your current version with `R.version`
* RStudio version 2025.05.1-513

## RStudio IDE

<center>![](figures/rstudio.png)</center>

Here is where you try and experiment, here is what you have saved in the workspace, here is where you write down things you want to keep for the future


## Git and GitHub 

- This course in general doesn't require knowledge on version control, but you will need to use access pages on GitHub. 

## Version control {.smaller background-image="figures/version-control.gif" background-size="30%" background-position="85% 50%"}

- Install Git: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
- Register a GitHub account: <https://github.com/>
- Reference: Happy Git with R

# Trick 101 to make you slightly more comfortable in R

## [Change the appearance of your RStudio IDE]{.r-fit-text} {.smaller}

press `Command + ,` to pull out the options panel

select the Appearance tab and find your favorite Editor font and theme

<center>![](figures/rstudio-appearance.png)</center>

## Coding is never memorization!

Ask anyone you know working with data or software to write down what they just code on a piece of paper: fail...

<br> <br>

<center>What I mean by this `r set.seed(1234); emo::ji("arrow")`</center>

## [Example: search and install from GitHub]{.r-fit-text} {.smaller}

I want to add emoji in the lecture slides and I know there is the `emo` package. The syntax is `emo::ji("emoji_name")`. Type in the console:

```{r eval = FALSE}
emo::ji("evil")
```

> Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘emo’

Okay... I don't have the package in my lastest R installation, let's install it...

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("emo")
```

> Warning in install.packages : package ‘emo’ is not available for this version of R A version of this package for your version of R might be available elsewhere, see the ideas at https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Installing-packages

## [Example: search and install from GitHub]{.r-fit-text} {.smaller}

Aha - it's GitHub package (I know it is written by Hadley Wickham), let me find it:

```         
Google: emo ji Hadley github
```

and find this:

<center>![](figures/emoji-github.png)</center>

## [Example: search and install from GitHub]{.r-fit-text}

Scroll down to find this line, and run it in your console:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")
```

Now I can use the package:

```{r}
emo::ji("devil")
```

Lesson learnt:

-   No one can write the code in one go, we use a lot of helps ... and Google!
-   btw you just learned how to install a package both from CRAN (`install.packages()`) and from GitHub (`remotes::install_github()`).

## [More tips]{.smaller}

-   When you meet an error message you don’t understand, try search it on Google

<center>![](figures/error-msg.png)</center>

-   Use `?pkg::function` (e.g. `?dplyr::summarise`) to read the Helper page of a function if you can’t remember the details of a particular function or an argument

    -   go through the help page: 1) details of arguments, 2) examples

## [It doesn’t hurt to know a few tricks]{.r-fit-text}{.smaller background-image="figures/dplyr-pkgdown-1.png" background-size="60%" background-position="50% 80%"}

package pkgdown site: go to <https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr>

click the package link

## `pkgdown` site of the `dplyr` package {.smaller background-image="figures/dplyr-pkgdown-2.png" background-size="50%" background-position="50% 80%"}

- The **Get started** page for introductory materials
- The **Reference** page has all the functions available in the package
  - click one to see the documentation
- The **Articles** page contains more in-depth articles about the package

# [Quarto and Rmarkdown document]{.r-fit-text}

## R script and Quarto document

## Quarto

YAML (required), text (optional), code (optional)

write your things in a R script for programming, but mostly you will interact with RMarkdown/ Quarto document

-   Quarto: you can “write/ run code” in a “Word document”: open a template and render a pdf,
-   also render into a html document
-   do you know that: you can also write papers, books, making slides, writing CV, create website all with Quarto documents

## [Render (knitr) your first Quarto (Rmarkdown) document]{.r-fit-text}


````
File > New File > Quarto Document / R Markdown
````

:::{layout-ncol=2}

![quarto](figures/quarto.png)

![RMarkdown](figures/rmarkdown.png)

:::

## Quarto - YAML

  * title, subtitle name, date
  * specify output: pdf, html, fancy outputs: revealjs (how the slides are created)
  * add latex packages for math


## Quarto - text

Markdown: 

-  **Headings**: `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, `### Heading 3`
-  **Bold**: `**bold text**`
-  **Italics**: `*italic text*`
-  **Links**: `[link text](https://example.com)`
- quote: `>`


## Quarto - code

Chunk option beginner pack: warning, messages, cache, eval, echo, fig.align: "center", fig.width, fig.height, out.width, out.height, 

-  **Inline code**: `` `code` ``


never put `install.packages(xxx)` in your Quarto/ Rmarkdown file

# Project structure

* Always open from the `.Rproj` file - check the top RHS
* use `here::here()`: `read_csv(here::here("data/xxx.csv))`
* 


## R history and ecosystem

S (Roger's week 2 slides)

Base R + packages

# A mature way to ask for help

`reprex`

# R beginner pack

basic calculation: `1 + 1`
assign `<-` and `=`
function(arguments)
pipe: `function2(function(arguments), arguments)`: `function(arguments) |> function2(arguments)`
`|>` and `%>%`


## Best practice

lower_case
