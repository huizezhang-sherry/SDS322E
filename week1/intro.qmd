## Learning objectives

**End goal**: Become comfortable coding in R for both exploratory (week 1-8) and confirmatory analysis (week 9-14), and develop enough breadth of knowledge to know where to find the tools and information you need.

. . .

Specifically, you will learn:

-   Program for data analysis in R using RStudio
-   Wrangle and visualize data with the tidyverse
-   Apply prediction and classification techniques

## Interaction & Communication

-   Announcements in Canvas

-   Ask questions after lecture (I usually reserve some time)

-   Office hours: Ask questions / Listen to others/ Review feedback on assignments

## Interaction & Communication

-   Email

    -   Subject: include course code (SDS 322E), reason for emailing
    -   Plan ahead: I will get back to you within 1-2 business days
    -   Don’t expect answers during the weekend or after 5pm

# Tricks and tips to make you slightly more comfortable in R and RStudio

## Install R and RStudio

-   R is available for free: <https://cloud.r-project.org/>
-   RStudio can be downloaded for free from the Posit website: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

Even if you installed R/RStudio previously, it's important to have the latest version

-   R version 4.5.1
    -   Check your current version with `R.version`
-   RStudio version 2025.05.1-513

## RStudio IDE

<center>![](figures/rstudio.png){width="90%"}</center>

## [Change the appearance of your RStudio IDE]{.r-fit-text} {.smaller}

-   Go to `Tools > Global Options` (or Press `Command + ,`) to pull out the options panel 
-   Select the Appearance tab and find your favorite Editor font and theme

<center>![](figures/rstudio-appearance.png){width="80%"}</center>

## Git and GitHub

General speaking, you can navigate the course without knowing anything about Git and GitHub, but you will be able to see and know many things you would otherwise won't if you do know a little bit.

-   If you know how to browse GitHub, you can see the source code of the packages we use in the course, and you can also see the source code of the lecture slides.

## Find the `pkgdown` site of a package {.smaller background-image="figures/dplyr-pkgdown-1.png" background-size="65%" background-position="50% 70%"}

Go to <https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr> and click the package link:

##  {.smaller}

The `pkgdown` site contains the exact same information as `?PKG::FUN()` but the HTML version is much better formatted.

The `pkgdown` sites also have more detailed vignettes (aka articles) about the package:

<center>![](figures/pkgdown-get-started.png)</center>

## Coding is never memorization!

Ask anyone you know who works with data or software to write down their code on paper in one go...

. . .

<center>It is almost guaranteed to fail.</center>

. . .

<br><br>

<center>Let's see this through an emoji example `r emo::ji("banana")` `r emo::ji("monkey")` `r emo::ji("eyes")` `r emo::ji("computer")` `r set.seed(1234); emo::ji("arrow")`</center>

## [Example: search and install from GitHub]{.r-fit-text} {.smaller}

I want to add emoji in the lecture slides and I know there is the `emo` package. The syntax is `emo::ji("emoji_name")`. Type in the console:

```{r eval = FALSE}
emo::ji("evil")
```

> Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘emo’

. . .

Okay... I don't have the package in my lastest R installation, let's install it...

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("emo")
```

> Warning in install.packages : package ‘emo’ is not available for this version of R A version of this package for your version of R might be available elsewhere, see the ideas at https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Installing-packages

## [Example: search and install from GitHub]{.r-fit-text} {.smaller}

Aha - it's GitHub package (I know it is written by Hadley Wickham), let me find it:

<center>Google: emo ji Hadley github</center>

and find this:

<center>![](figures/emoji-github.png)</center>

## [Example: search and install from GitHub]{.r-fit-text}

<center>![](figures/emoji-github-2.png)</center>

## [Example: search and install from GitHub]{.r-fit-text}

Scroll down to find this line, and run it in your console:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")
```

. . .

Now I can use the package:

```{r}
emo::ji("devil")
emo::ji("heart")
emo::ji("computer")
emo::ji("climber")
```

## [Example: search and install from GitHub]{.r-fit-text}

If I want to use functions from a pacakge multiple times, it is easier to load the package first: `library(pkg)`

```{r}
library(emo)
ji("climber")
ji("aeroplane")
ji("computer")
```

. . .

What happen if you don't?

```{r eval=FALSE}
ji("climber")
```

> Error in ji("climber") : could not find function "ji"

## Lesson learnt

-   No one can write the code in one go, there are lots of trials and errors. Along the way, we use a lot of helps, including Google!

-   Btw you just happen to know how to

    -   install a package from CRAN: `install.packages()` and from GitHub: `devtools::install_github()`

    -   load a package: `library()`

## Your time (1/2) {.smaller}

-   Install R and RStudio if you have not yet

-   Change the appearance of your RStudio IDE:

    -   Go to `Tools > Global Options` (or Press `Command + ,`) to pull out the options panel 

    -   Select the Pane Layout tab to move around the panes
    
    - Select the Appearance tab and find your favorite Editor font and theme

## Your time (2/2) {.smaller}

-   Install and load the `tidyverse` package from CRAN

    -   Install: `install.packages("tidyverse")`
    -   Load: `library(tidyverse)`

-   (advance) Install and load the `emo` package from GitHub

    -   Install the CRAN package `devtools` first: `install.packages("devtools")`
    -   Install the `emo` package from GitHub: `devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")`
    -   Load the library: `library(emo)`
    -   Print your favorite emoji, e.g. `emo::ji("heart")`
