## Class to Brainrot 

* Being able to work with an R Markdown document — Your labs/HWs/Projects will be provided in this format, and you’ll need to knit them into a PDF for submission.

. . .

  * Of cause, you will need to have R and RStudio installed, and know how to install packages.


## Hi -  I'm an R script! {.smaller}

<https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/main/R/summarise.R>

* Code is first class citizens here and all the text and comments need to start with `#` (`#'` is a special symbol used for package documentation).

* Text are first class citizens here. Generally you won't interact with me directly in this class but I lay the foundation for R Markdown documents.

(The first line says *README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file*)

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width = "60%"}

* I will be the document you mainly work with in this class. 

* I’m more powerful than the previous two guys because I can 

  * include both text and code (in code chunks), 
  * run the code to produce output, and 
  * render the results to multiple formats such as HTML, PDF, and Word.

*Most of the references/books in this class are written R Markdown (or its newer generation - Quarto).*
